# JobSearch
Uses GitHub Jobs API to create a job filter, that gets the first 50 jobs in the location and job you specify, and finds the top 20 most used skills for that job in that location. The script outputs the top 20 skills in order of how much they are used, and beside each skill, is listed the percentage that they are found in the search.
